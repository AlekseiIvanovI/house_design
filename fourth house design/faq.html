												<h3>What is the process of designing a house?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Designing a house involves several stages, starting with an initial 
                                                consultation to understand your requirements and preferences. The designer
                                                will then create conceptual designs, develop detailed floor plans, and work
                                                on exterior and interior design elements. The process also includes selecting
                                                materials, coordinating with contractors, and overseeing the construction phase to ensure the design vision is realized.</p>
